This project leverages artificial intelligence to assist in diagnosing two critical health conditions, aiming to enhance medical accuracy and efficiency:

Parkinson's Disease: Early detection using patient data such as acoustic signals and motion biomarkers, helping in timely intervention.

Brain Tumors: Analysis and classification of tumors through medical imaging, including MRI scans, to support treatment planning.

By automating parts of the diagnostic process, this project seeks to minimize human error, speed up analysis, and improve patient outcomes. It provides a foundation for integrating AI into healthcare systems for advanced diagnostic support.
