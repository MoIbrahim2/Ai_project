This project is an AI-based solution designed to assist in medical diagnostics by analyzing medical data to detect two critical health conditions:

Parkinson's Disease
Brain Tumors

The project leverages some advanced machine learning models to provide accurate and efficient diagnostic support, reducing the time required for analysis and minimizing the likelihood of human error.
